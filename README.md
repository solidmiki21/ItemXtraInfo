# Item Xtra Info

Item Xtra Info is a mod that calculates item bonus, chances, stats and all that stuff. It only shows
when you hover the move over the **TAB** menu items.

This mod is a spiritual successor to [The ItemStatsMod](https://thunderstore.io/package/ontrigger/ItemStatsMod/) made by ontrigger, I think he stopped developing it so i am taking over the idea.

Currently I'm still working on it but it should be ~~good~~ enough to play.

I know there are a lot of mistakes and inconsistency and for that i need help, you can report
errors in the github page (create a new issue, suggestions appreciated aswell ^.^!) aswell as look into the code (which is pretty bad tbh).

BEPIN AS WELL AS R2API ARE BOTH REQUIRED FOR THE MOD TO WORK.

Installation is just dropping the .dll file into the plugins folders bepin creates.
